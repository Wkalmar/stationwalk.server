## Kyiv station walk
This project is Kyiv's clone of [London station walk](http://www.nationalparkcity.london/station_walks).
It is supposed to be non-profit project so I do not intend to violate copyright if there is any. In case of any legal issues feel free to contact me.
## Using npm
This is the client part. The package manager I've used to install typesrcipt and several other dependencies is npm, so make sure you perform `npm install` before running the project.
## Using Gulp
I've chosen Gulp as task manager for the project. For now I've setup `gulp live` task which performs typescript compilation and afterwards runs client on http://localhost:8080
## Installing server
The project required working backend which you can build from [here](https://github.com/Wkalmar/stationwalk.server). In case you don't want to mess up with F# feel free to contact me, I'll build you one
